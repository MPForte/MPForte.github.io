Hello! I am Paola!

I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at the Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems, working across the Haptic Intelligence Department (led by Dr. Katherine J. Kuchenbecker) and the Perceiving Systems Department (led by Dr. Michael J. Black).

My research aims to create assistive technology through interdisciplinary innovation. I develop human-sensing systems that combine computer vision with novel sensor technologies to capture complex human movements and interactions. This approach addresses fundamental challenges in human pose estimation, with applications extending from accessibility for the Deaf community—my main area of expertise—to broader domains such as mental health monitoring and human-computer interaction.

My Ph.D. thesis, "An Interdisciplinary Approach to Human Pose Estimation: Application to Sign Language," includes three first-author publications that bridge software and hardware innovation. At CVPR 2023, I introduced the first method to reconstruct 3D signing avatars from video using linguistic priors. Recognizing that visual systems struggle to capture self-touch—a critical component in nearly half of all signs—I developed bioimpedance-based sensing approaches. My work published in IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement demonstrates that bioimpedance can reliably detect self-touch across diverse individuals. Building on this, my hybrid system BioTUCH, presented at ICCV 2025, fuses bioimpedance sensing with visual pose estimation, improving 3D pose accuracy during self-contact events.

Beyond academic contributions, I am committed to translating research into real-world applications. My bioimpedance sensing technology has led to a provisional patent, and I am exploring its commercialization potential through entrepreneurship programs.
