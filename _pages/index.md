Hello! I am Maria-Paola Forte!

I am a Ph.D. Candidate in the Haptic Intelligence Department led by Dr. Katherine J. Kuchenbecker and in the Perceiving Systems Department led by Dr. Michael J. Black.

I received my BSc degree in Biomedical Engineering from the University of Genova in 2015 with the thesis "Crowd Motion Analysis using Optical Flow."

I earned my MSc degree in Bioengineering (Technologies for Electronics) at Politecnico di Milano in 2018. During my master's degree, I participated in an exchange program at the University of Queensland (Brisbane). My master's thesis research, "Robust Visual Augmented Reality in Robot-Assisted Surgery," was conducted at the Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems under the supervision of Dr. Katherine J. Kuchenbecker. 

My research aims to create technology that assists people. I am primarily interested in the development of assistive technology devices for people with sensory or motor deficits. My Ph.D. project focuses on sign language capture. I am also interested in investigating how technology enhances performance in highly specialized tasks, such as robotic surgery. My research combines vision-based and sensor-based approaches, and it spans the realityâ€“virtuality continuum.
