Hello! I am Paola!

I am an IMPRS-IS Ph.D. Candidate working across two departments at the Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems: the Haptic Intelligence Department led by Dr. Katherine J. Kuchenbecker and the Perceiving Systems Department led by Dr. Michael J. Black.

My research aims to create assistive technology through interdisciplinary innovation. I am primarily interested in developing human-sensing systems that combine computer vision with novel sensor technologies to capture complex human movements.
This approach addresses fundamental challenges, with applications extending from accessibility for the Deaf community, my main area of expertise, to broader domains where understanding human pose and contact is important.
My Ph.D. thesis, "An Interdisciplinary Approach to Human Pose Estimation: Application to Sign Language," advances my work in creating assistive technology.

I received my B.Sc. degree in Biomedical Engineering from the University of Genova in 2015 with the thesis "Crowd Motion Analysis using Optical Flow" (supervised by Dr. Fabio Solari) and my M.Sc. degree in Bioengineering (Technologies for Electronics) at Politecnico di Milano in 2018 with the thesis "Robust Visual Augmented Reality in Robot-Assisted Surgery" (supervised by Dr. Katherine J. Kuchenbecker at the Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems). During my master's degree, I participated in an exchange program at the University of Queensland (Brisbane).
